## Brief Intro & Rules
Players control a robotic mining vehicle with the goal of tunneling as deep as possible into the earth to collect precious ores. The primary gameplay loop involves:

  1. Resource Management: Balancing fuel levels and cargo capacity. Players must return to the surface to sell minerals and refuel before running out of gas.
  2. Upgrading: Using the profits from mining to upgrade the hull (durability), fuel tank, drill speed, and engine power.
  3. Progression: Digging deeper to find rarer, more valuable minerals while uncovering the mysteries hidden at the planet's core.

**Challenge 1: The Minesweeper Fog (Strategic Digging)**
The major twist to the original formula is the "Hidden Block" system. Players cannot see what lies beneath or beside them. By integrating Minesweeper rules, the vehicle must scan surrounding tiles to reveal numbers. These numbers indicate how many hazards (or traps) are adjacent, transforming the game from a simple digging race into a high-stakes logic puzzle.

**Challenge 2: Environmental Hazards & Specialized Gear**
Beyond standard bombs, players will encounter dynamic threats like toxic gas pockets, flowing lava or monsters. Digging into these without the proper "Hazmat Shield" or "Coolant Probe" will result in immediate damage or death. This forces players to choose between upgrading for deeper exploration or purchasing defensive tools to survive these lethal obstacles.

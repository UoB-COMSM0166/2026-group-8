# Game Name: MineScan: Deep Below

## Brief Intro & Rules
MineScan: Deep Below is a strategic mining adventure inspired by the classic flash game Motherload, but with a high-stakes twist based on Minesweeper logic. Players control a mining pod digging deep into an alien planet to collect rare minerals and upgrade their gear.

However, the path downward is shrouded in mystery. Blocks are initially hidden; instead of mindless digging, players must use a built-in "Proximity Scanner" to detect adjacent threats. Numbers revealed on cleared blocks indicate how many hazards (bombs, gas pockets, or lava) are lurking in the surrounding eight tiles. Precision is key—one wrong move could lead to a catastrophic explosion or a lethal leak.

**Challenge 1:** The Blind Descent Unlike traditional mining games where you can see your target, you must rely entirely on logic and scanning tools. As you go deeper, the scanner’s accuracy may fluctuate, forcing you to invest in expensive sensor upgrades or risk "blind digging" when fuel runs low.

**Challenge 2:** Environmental Hazards & Resolution It’s not just about bombs. You may strike high-pressure gas pockets or hidden lava veins. These hazards require specific "Emergency Kits" or "Neutralizing Probes" to resolve. Managing your limited inventory space between valuable minerals and life-saving tools creates a constant tension between greed and survival.

# Game Name: Bullet Dodge Survival

## Brief Intro & Rules

Bullet Dodge Survival is a fast-paced survival game focused on precision movement and pattern recognition.
Players control a character that can move freely to dodge incoming bullets. There is no health system—any contact with a bullet results in instant game over. The goal is to survive for as long as possible, with the final score determined purely by total survival time.
Enemies are fixed in position and continuously fire bullets in straight lines. All bullets are automatically destroyed once they leave the screen, keeping the playfield clean and readable.

## Challenges

The core challenge comes from time-based difficulty scaling, where bullet density, firing frequency, and attack patterns increase as the run progresses.

- 0–10 seconds:
Bullets are fired in a circular radial pattern, spreading outward and introducing basic movement challenges.

- 10–30 seconds:
Firing frequency increases, creating higher bullet density and requiring tighter, more precise dodging.

- 30+ seconds:
Multiple attack patterns are introduced, including circular bursts, fan-shaped spreads, and rotating or spiral bullet formations.These patterns may alternate or overlap, dramatically increasing pressure and testing the player’s reaction speed and spatial awareness.

# Game Name: BLOCK version 1.30

## Brief Intro & Rules
In this game, players control a sliding bar (called a "paddle") at the bottom of the screen. The goal is to hit a ball and break all the bricks above. Unlike other games, BLOCK version 1.30 lets you control the paddle more actively. The main gameplay includes:

  1. Moving and Hitting: Players move the paddle left and right to catch the ball and keep it on the screen.
  2. The "Jump" Action: This is the most special part of the game. When you press the Spacebar, the paddle jumps up. You can use this to hit the ball harder or change its direction.
  3. Getting Power-ups: When some bricks break, special items fall down. If you catch them, the ball might get bigger, the paddle might get longer, or you might get more balls.
  4. Level Progress: You pass the level after you break every brick on the screen.

**Challenge 1: Real Physics (The Jumping Paddle)**
The biggest technical challenge is making the "Jump" feel real. In many games, the paddle is just a flat wall. In the game, the paddle has its own speed when it jumps. We need to write code to calculate how the ball moves when it hits a jumping paddle. This makes the game more fun and skillful for the players.

**Challenge 2: Gravity and Environment**
To make the game harder, the game added "Gravity". The ball does not just move in a straight line; it slowly falls down like a real ball. Also, some levels have special areas, like "Heavy Zones", that pull the ball in different directions. Players must time their jumps carefully to win.
